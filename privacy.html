            <strong>The short version:</strong> HabitKit does not collect,
            transmit, or share any personal data. All your habit data is stored
            locally on your device. We have no servers, no analytics, and no
            tracking.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy describes how HabitKit ("the App"), developed by
          Vlad Zhila ("we", "us", or "our"), handles information when you use
          the App on your iOS device.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are committed to protecting your privacy. HabitKit was designed
          from the ground up to keep your personal data under your control.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>
          HabitKit does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any of
          the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)
          </li>
          <li>Location data</li>
          <li>Device identifiers or advertising IDs</li>
          <li>Usage analytics or behavioral data</li>
          <li>
            Health or fitness data beyond what you manually enter as habits
          </li>
          <li>Contacts, photos, or other device data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
        <p>
          All data you create in HabitKit — your habits, completion records,
          preferences, and settings — is stored
          <strong>exclusively on your device</strong> using Apple's SwiftData
          framework and UserDefaults.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you use the Home Screen Widget, a copy of your habit data is shared
          between the main app and the widget extension through an Apple App
          Group container. This data never leaves your device.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Notifications</h2>
        <p>
          If you enable habit reminders, HabitKit uses Apple's local
          notification system (UNUserNotificationCenter) to schedule
          notifications on your device. These notifications are processed
          entirely on-device and are not routed through any external server.
        </p>

        <h2>5. In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>
          HabitKit offers optional in-app purchases (subscriptions and a
          lifetime unlock) through Apple's StoreKit framework. All payment
          processing is handled entirely by Apple. We do not receive, store, or
          have access to your payment information, Apple ID, or transaction
          details.
        </p>
        <p>
          For information about how Apple handles your purchase data, please
          refer to
          <a
            href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Apple's Privacy Policy</a
          >.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Export & Import</h2>
        <p>
          HabitKit includes an optional JSON export/import feature. When you
          export your data, a file is generated locally on your device. Where
          you send or store that file is entirely under your control. We do not
          receive a copy of your exported data.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          HabitKit does <strong>not</strong> integrate with any third-party
          analytics, advertising, crash reporting, or tracking services. The App
          contains no third-party SDKs that collect user data.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          HabitKit does not knowingly collect information from children under
          the age of 13. Since we do not collect any personal data from any
          user, the App is safe for users of all ages.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Data Deletion</h2>
        <p>
          Since all data is stored locally on your device, you can delete all
          HabitKit data at any time by:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Deleting individual habits within the App</li>
          <li>
            Uninstalling the App from your device (this removes all associated
            data)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make
          material changes, the updated policy will be posted on this page with
          a revised effective date. Your continued use of the App after changes
          are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Contact</h2>
